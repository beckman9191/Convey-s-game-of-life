Hotkeys: (I choose to impletement the second feature)
P <- pause, which also means that we switch to the manual mode
N <- advance one frame at a time
R <- resume to the automatic mode

Note:
Due to some initialization bug, the gradle JVM is set to version 16 instead of version 11 when I was developed in the local environment.
I will get "Could not open init generic class cache for initialization script" error when I was using version 11.
